#' Contact rate parameters
#'
#' Modeling the relationship between density and contact rates in wild deer
#' populations. Habib et al. (2011) used radio-collared deer in eastern Alberta
#' to, in part, estimate contact rates between deer in the same group and deer
#' in different groups. These results are unique as they calculate the per
#' capita contact rate in terms of deer contacted/individual/time. This differs
#' from many other approaches, which just look at the raw probability of two
#' collared individuals being in the same place at the same time. Habib et al.
#' (2011) estimated home ranges, contact rates, and resource selection functions
#' across variable densities and habitat conditions (areas with 12%, 26%, 53%,
#' and 67% wooded habitat). They then simulated individual white-tailed deer and
#' their movements based on these observed data to estimate the total number of
#' individuals in contact, which was the sum of contact rates within the same
#' group and with different groups. They estimated the most likely
#' parameters for the per-capita contact rate.
