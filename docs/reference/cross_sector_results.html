top performing alternative action for each OneHealth sectors (public health,
agriculture, and wildlife sectors) on the prevalence, persistence and
cumulative infections of SARS-CoV-2 in simulated white-tailed deer
populations. 1000 iterations (run_id) were run for captive and wild
populations of white-tailed deer, separated by a single fenceline that allows
proximity and direct contact between captive and wild deer (Complex), under
the alternative identified for public health, agriculture, and wildlife
(Alternative) that have the greatest reduction in prevalence, persistence,
and cumulative infections. Complexes include captive deer in outdoor ranch
facilities and wild deer in rural areas (Outdoor ranch and rural deer),
captive deer in outdoor ranch facilities and wild deer in suburban areas
(Outdoor ranch and suburban deer), captive deer in intensive facilities and
wild deer in rural areas (Intensive facility and rural deer), and captive
deer in intensive facilities and wild deer in suburban areas (Intensive
facility and suburban deer). Cross-sector collaboration would vaccinate and
boost captive deer (agriculture sector), require personal protective
equipment for humans interacting with deer in wild and captive settings
(public health sector), and eliminate baiting practices through legislation,
enforcement, and education (wildlife sector).
Wild and captive prevalence (meanWild and meanCaptive, respectively) are
reported as the percent of a population infected, averaged over a simulated
120-day projection (run_id), for a particular alternative applied to a
particular context. Cumulative infections reports the total proportion of the
wild and captive populations infected over the course of the 120-fall
projection (cumulativeWild and cumulativeCaptive, respectively), and can
exceed 1, indicating that all individuals were infected at least once during
the fall season, for a particular alternative applied to a particular
context. Persistence is a logical condition indicating if equilibrium
determined by SIRS ODE equations and run_steady() from the rootSolve
package predicts at least 1 in 1,000 deer infected at equilibrium for wild
and captive deer (persistWild and persistCaptive, respectively), for a
particular alternative applied to a particular context."><title>cross_sector_results — cross_sector_results • whitetailedSIRS</title><script src="../deps/jquery-3.6.0/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"><link href="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- bootstrap-toc --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js" integrity="sha256-4veVQbu7//Lk5TSmc7YV48MxtMy98e26cf5MrgZYnwo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- search --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fuse.js/6.4.6/fuse.js" integrity="sha512-zv6Ywkjyktsohkbp9bb45V6tEMoWhzFzXis+LrMehmJZZSys19Yxf1dopHx7WzIKxr5tK2dVcYmaCk2uqdjF4A==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autocomplete.js/0.38.0/autocomplete.jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-GU9ayf+66Xx2TmpxqJpliWbT5PiGYxpaG8rfnBEk1LL8l1KGkRShhngwdXK1UgqhAzWpZHSiYPc09/NwDQIGyg==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mark.js/8.11.1/mark.min.js" integrity="sha512-5CYOlHXGh6QpOFA/TeTylKLWfB3ftPsde7AnmhuitiTX4K5SqCLBeKro6sPS8ilsz1Q4NRx3v8Ko2IBiszzdww==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="cross_sector_results — cross_sector_results"><meta property="og:description" content="A dataframe containing results used to compare cumulative influences of the
