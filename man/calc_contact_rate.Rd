\usage{
calc_contact_rate(
  sigma_season = NULL,
  scaling_c = NULL,
  N_w = NULL,
  q = NULL,
  A_w = NULL,
  nsamples = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  type_contact = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigma_season}{value for season scaling (optional). Default set to 1}

\item{scaling_c}{value for contact scaling constant (influences slope of density-contact relationship; reported in Habib et al. 2011)}

\item{N_w}{total population size of deer. Defaults is a random draw from a Poisson distribution with mean = 1000.}

\item{q}{value for concavity scaling constant (0-1, with 0 equating to density dependence and 1 equating to frequency dependence; reported in Habib et al. 2011)}

\item{A_w}{area inhabited by N, in square kilometers. Default set to 100 square kilometers to match Habib et al.'s (2011) approach.}

\item{nsamples}{number of values to be returned. Default is 1, but will return a vector if > 2}

\item{seed}{if specified, sets a seed for the function}

\item{type_contact}{option between "low", "medium", and "high" based on parameters from Habib et al. 2011 for particular values of wooded habitat available to the deer population in question. "low" contact fixes scaling_c to 16.37 and q to 0.53, mimicking proximity rates in areas with 53\% wooded habitat. "med" contact fixes scaling_c to 11.35 and q to 0.34, mimicking proximity rates in areas with 26\% wooded habitat. "high" contact fixes scaling_c to 15.58 and q to 0.32, mimicking proximity rates in areas with 12\% wooded habitat. If set to "manual", manual input of scaling_c and q are needed. All values from Habib et al. (2011) are available in the \code{contact_rate_params} dataset.}
}
\value{
returns a number or numeric vector if nsamples > 1
}
\description{
\code{calc_contact_rate()} uses proximity rate model developed by Habib et al. (2011) to estimate proximity rates for deer in wild settings, conditional on density and habitat availability. This function can also be used for captive settings with conditions that result in identical deer-deer proximity rates.
