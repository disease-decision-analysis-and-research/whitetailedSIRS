\code{alternatives_across_systems}
A data frame with 9 columns and 10000 rows storing the results of outbreak
simulations given a particular management alternative (Alternative). Each row
corresponds to an iteration of the simulation, with a specific complex,
alternative implemented, and random draw of epidemiological parameters:
\describe{
\item{run_id}{Identifier of run iteration}
\item{Complex}{Combination of wild and captive scenarios interacting along
a fenceline}
\item{Alternative}{Management alternative implemented}
\item{meanWild}{Mean daily prevelance in wild deer in the complex}
\item{meanCaptive}{Mean daily prevelance in captive deer in the complex}
\item{cumulativeWild}{Incidence proportion in wild deer in the complex}
\item{cumulativeCaptive}{Incidence proportion in captive deer in the
complex}
\item{persistWild}{Probability of persistence in wild deer in the complex}
\item{persistCaptive}{Probability of persistence in captive deer in the
complex}

\description{
A dataframe containing results used to compare influences of potential
management alternatives on the prevalence, persistence and cumulative
infections of SARS-CoV-2 in simulated white-tailed deer populations. 1000
iterations (run_id) were run for captive and wild populations of white-tailed
deer, seperated by a single fenceline that allows proximity and direct
contact between captive and wild deer (Complex), under each alternative
implemented (Alternative). Complexes include captive deer in outdoor ranch
facilities and wild deer in rural areas (Outdoor ranch and rural deer),
captive deer in outdoor ranch facilities and wild deer in suburban areas
(Outdoor ranch and suburban deer), captive deer in intensive facilities and
wild deer in rural areas (Intensive facility and rural deer), and captive
deer in intensive facilities and wild deer in suburban areas (Intensive
facility and suburban deer). Management alternatives (Alternative) include
\enumerate{
\item no action (baseline), 2) improve separation between captive and wild deer
by improving fencing (double-fence captive facilities), 3) reduce and
eliminate baiting practices through legislation, enforcement, and education
(Eliminate baiting), 4) increase air flow in indoor facilities to match air
exchange rate in outdoor settings (Improve indoor facility air quality; only
applies for complexes with intensive facilities), 5) Cease research
activities that would bring research and management staff in close proximity
with wild deer (Pause Research), 6) Require personal protective equipment for
humans during interactions with deer in both captive and wild settings (PPE,
Both), 7) Require PPE in captive settings only (PPE, Captive), 8) Require PPE
in wild settings only (PPE, Wild), 9) Reduce wild deer densities by 10\% to
reduce deer-deer contact rate and spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Reduce wild density
by 10\%), 10) Reduce wild deer densities by 25\% to reduce deer-deer contact
rate and spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Reduce wild density by 25\%), 11) restrict
human activities in areas posing elevated probability of human-deer
interactions, such as suburban neighborhoods, parks, trail heads, etc.
(Restrict human interactions), 12) Vaccinate and repeatedly boost captive
deer (Vaccinate and boost captive deer), and 13) provide initial vaccination
to captive deer with no secondary boosting (Vaccinate captive deer). Wild and
captive prevalence (meanWild and meanCaptive, respectively) are reported as
the percent of a population infected, averaged over a simulated 120-day
projection (run_id), for a particular alternative applied to a particular
context. Cumulative infections reports the total proportion of the wild and
captive populations infected over the course of the 120-fall projection
(cumulativeWild and cumulativeCaptive, respectively), and can exceed 1,
indicating that all individuals were infected at least once during the fall
season, for a particular alternative applied to a particular context.
Persistence is a logical condition indicating if equilibrium determined by
SIRS ODE equations and \code{run_steady()} from the rootSolve package predicts at
least 1 in 1,000 deer infected at equilibrium for wild and captive deer
(persistWild and persistCaptive, respectively), for a particular alternative
applied to a particular context.
