\description{
\code{alternative()} helps to prepare parameters used to solve SIRS ODE equations for both wild and captive deer, to be fed into the params argument of the \code{run()} function.
}
\details{
alternative() creates a list of parameter values that will be fed into a SIRS ODE solver. The length of each item in the output is determined by the length of all arguments, which must be equal. If argument(s) is not filled with outputs from another function in this package (e.g. calc_contact_rate, calc_nu_aero, calc_nu_dc, draw_elicitation_samples), the user must fill argument with vector of values of the same length as the other arguments.

Parameter values defined with this function remained fixed during SIRS ODE solves. While these parameter values can be derived through random processes, projections are deterministic.

Proximity, by default with the calc_nu_aero() function, is defined as two individuals entering within 1.5m of each other. This proximity limit can be modified in V_air argument in the calc_nu_aero() function, which defines a half-sphere volume into which aerosolized virus is exhaled from an infectious individual.
