\usage{
initial_compartments(
  S_wild_prop = 1,
  I_wild_prop = 0,
  R_wild_prop = 0,
  S_captive_prop = 1,
  I_captive_prop = 0,
  R_captive_prop = 0,
  draws = NULL,
  steady = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S_wild_prop}{Size of susceptible compartment in wild population
(proportion)}

\item{I_wild_prop}{Size of infectious compartment in wild population
(proportion)}

\item{R_wild_prop}{Size of recovered compartment in wild population
(proportion)}

\item{S_captive_prop}{Size of susceptible compartment in captive population
(proportion)}

\item{I_captive_prop}{Size of infectious compartment in captive population
(proportion)}

\item{R_captive_prop}{Size of recovered compartment in captive population
(proportion)}

\item{draws}{Number of iterations of simulation}

\item{steady}{Logical argument to state whether these initial compartments
will be used to calculate compartment sizes as steady state equilibrium
(steady = TRUE), or for a projection through a specified time period
(steady = FALSE; default).}
}
\value{
List of six vectors (steady == TRUE) or eight vectors (steady ==
FALSE), repeating starting conditions specified by user. Length of vectors
are determined by draws argument. When steady == FALSE, output will contain
starting values for tracking cumulative infections (I_wild_cumulative and
I_captive_cumulative), both set to zero.
}
\description{
Define starting compartment sizes for SIRS ODE Solver
}
\details{
Provides a vector of compartment sizes for wild and captive
populations. This function pairs wild and captive deer populations so that
transmission between populations can occur. Values (except for draws
parameter) must be proportions, and must sum to one for each population.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
initial_compartments(S_wild_prop = 0, draws = 5) #Starting conditions for a
#simulation focused only on captive deer
initial_compartments(draws = 5) #Starting conditions for a simulation of
#introduction and spread in both wild and captive deer.}
