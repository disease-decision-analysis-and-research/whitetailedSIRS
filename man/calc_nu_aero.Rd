\description{
\code{calc_nu_aero} will calculate one value for probability of infection using
defaults if no arguments are provided. Defaults are described in the
sir_model_description document and are sourced from the literature or expert
elicitation.

\details{
Mathematical background for this calculation. An infected
individual emits viral particles at a particular rate \eqn{ER_q} in
quanta/hr as the
product of the arguments described above: \deqn{ER_q = C_{\nu} \cdot C_i
  \cdot ER \cdot V_d} This is used to model the instantaneous concentration
of viral particles (C) in well-mixed air space (quanta/\eqn{m^3}) around an
infected individual as follows: \deqn{C = \frac{ER_q}{IVRR \cdot V_{air}}}
where the loss rate (IVRR) is given by: \deqn{AER + s + \lambda} When a
susceptible individual enters the contaminated airspace surrounding an
infected individual, the dose (\eqn{Q_A}) is the product of inhalation
rate, concentration of viral particles, and time of contact: \deqn{Q_A = IR
  \cdot C \cdot t_{contact}} The dose \eqn{Q_A} is converted into a
probability of infection using the Wells-Riley infection model as a
function of the dose received and a species-specific probability of
infection from 1 quantum. \deqn{\nu^{AERO} = 1 - e^{-rQ}}
