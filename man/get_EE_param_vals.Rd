\title{get_EE_param_vals: Prepare random draws for inputs in the SIRS ODE equations.}
\usage{
get_EE_param_vals(data, my_param)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset containing random draws for parameters estimate with
expert elicitation.}

\item{my_param}{Character string for parameters estimated with expert
elicitation.}
}
\value{
vector of random samples from error distributions estimated with
expert elicitation, with a length determined by the number of iterations run
for a simulation (nsamples argument, draw_elicitation_samples.R).
}
\description{
get_EE_param_vals: Prepare random draws for inputs in the SIRS ODE equations.

\details{
This function requires that draw_elicitation_samples() be run prior.
The output of draw_elicitation_samples is the input argument for this
function (my_param).  Options for parameters include: "Temporary Immunity",
"Wastewater Infections","Fomite Infections","Viral Load","Dose-Response",
"Deer Proximity Duration (minutes)", "Direct Contact Probability",
"Proximity rate with baiting (17 events without baiting)",
"Deer-Human Proximity Rate, Rural (per 120 days)",
"Deer-Human Proximity Duration, Rural (minutes)", "Deer-Human Proximity Rate,
Suburban (per 120 days)", "Deer-Human Proximity Duration, Suburban (minutes)"
, "Deer-Human Proximity Rate, Captive (per 120 days)", "Deer-Human Proximity
Duration, Captive (minutes)", "Deer-Deer Proximity Rate, Captive (per day)".
Only one parameter may be retrieved in a get_EE_param_vals() call.
